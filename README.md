# GHG-Dashboard-Virginia
Welcome to Virginia's Greenhouse Gas Inventory Dashboard, an innovative and data-driven initiative aimed at addressing the critical issue of greenhouse gas emissions in the state.

The goal of this project is to centralise and visualise data from various state and federal entities in charge of tracking emissions, providing policymakers, environmentalists, researchers, and the general public with real-time insights into Virginia's carbon footprint.  We invite you to explore the tools, contribute to our mission, and join us in the pursuit of a more sustainable and environmentally responsible future for Virginia, with this repository serving as a hub for documentation, development, and collaboration.
