# GHG-Dashboard-Virginia
Welcome to Virginia's Greenhouse Gas Inventory Dashboard, an innovative and data-driven initiative aimed at addressing the critical issue of greenhouse gas emissions in the state.

Emissions of certain gases known as GHG increase the temperature of the planet because these gases can trap heat and these gases are often called 'Greenhouse gases' because they act like thermal gas as they trap heat inside and emit light. Direct emitters, Carbon dioxide injection (CO2), Suppliers are the three most common and important greenhouse gases. 

Different types of Scope emissions:
Many companies are trying to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. When it comes to reporting trends, you will often see terms like scope 1, scope 2, and scope 3 emissions.
Scope 1: GHG Emissions During Manufacturing
To determine the greenhouse fuel (GHG) emissions related to the production method of a particular product.
Scope 2: GHG Emissions from Product Use
To determine the GHG emissions that occur during the use or operation of the product with the aid of purchasers or end-users.
Scope 3: GHG Emissions from End-of-Life, disposal, and third-party emissions
To assess the GHG emissions associated with the end-of-life and disposal stages of the product, along with recycling, landfilling, incineration, and any other emissions.


Research :
We have studied a few research papers, journals, and internet sources to have a better understanding of this project topic. The first research paper is “Federal Strategy to Advance Greenhouse Gas Emissions Measurement and Monitoring for the Agriculture and Forest Sectors”. The development of a preliminary system for monitoring greenhouse gas (GHG) and clearings within the agriculture and forest divisions is described in this paper. This technology is a component of a larger plan to establish a framework for data collection and greenhouse gas monitoring in the US. Earlier government studies that examine the annual stock of changes in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions served as the foundation for this project. It also gains from recent developments in modeling and estimation as well as the growing accessibility of GHG observational data. Agriculture today directly accounts for 10% of the increase in U.S. GHG emissions, despite the forest sector acting as a net GHG sink by storing more emissions than it releases. Therefore, these areas are important gaps where GHG can provide support. The section underlines the significance of agriculture and forests in comprehensive GHG monitoring projects to support efforts to stabilize the climate. It also emphasizes how important it is to fill in the current gaps and needs in the estimation and observation of GHG emissions.

Solution space: This project underscores the critical need for comprehensive and transparent GHG emissions data. Our work demonstrates the power of data visualization in environmental analysis, providing stakeholders with a clearer picture of emissions trends and the challenges in data collection. By spotlighting these issues, we aim to foster informed decision-making and encourage greater transparency and completeness in environmental reporting, crucial for effective policy formulation and environmental sustainability in Virginia.


Product Vision: The vision for this project's product – the GHG emissions dashboard – is to create an innovative, comprehensive tool that not only presents a clear picture of the current state of GHG emissions in Virginia but also bridges critical data gaps. This dashboard will be an indispensable resource for a range of stakeholders, including environmental policymakers, researchers, and the public, enabling them to access, understand, and analyze emissions data with ease.

The product will stand out for its ability to integrate and visualize complex data sets, making use of advanced extrapolation techniques to provide a fuller picture of emissions where data is lacking. Its user-friendly interface will ensure that users, regardless of their technical expertise, can easily navigate and derive insights from the tool. Ultimately, the dashboard aims to be a catalyst for more informed and effective environmental policy and action, underpinned by the principles of transparency, accuracy, and accessibility. It will serve as a model for other states and regions facing similar challenges in GHG emissions reporting and analysis.

Data Context: 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) places a high emphasis on ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and credibility of the data and information it disseminates. To achieve this, the EPA implements rigorous quality assurance (QA) procedures across its various programs and initiatives. These QA measures often encompass the development of Quality Assurance Project Plans (QAPPs) that outline the data collection and validation processes, routine audits and reviews of data sources, and the establishment of standardized protocols and methodologies.

Summary: 
The project focused on addressing the significant challenge of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting in Virginia, particularly the gap between state-level and sub-state level data. Our primary objective was to develop a comprehensive dashboard tool to visualize GHG emissions across the state, with a specific emphasis on bridging the reporting discrepancies between Northern and Southern Virginia.

The project began with an extensive data collection phase, gathering emissions data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ), and local agencies. Special attention was given to Northern Virginia due to its more detailed reporting. A critical part of the project was identifying the gaps in data, especially for Southern Virginia, where emissions reporting was notably deficient. This gap analysis was crucial for understanding the scope and scale of the reporting challenges.

To address these data gaps, we employed data extrapolation and predictive modeling techniques. This approach allowed us to estimate missing data points, thereby providing a fuller and more accurate picture of GHG emissions across the state. The culmination of our efforts was the development of an interactive, user-friendly dashboard. This tool not only displays the actual reported data but also incorporates the extrapolated estimates, offering a comprehensive view of GHG emissions in Virginia.

Our project makes significant contributions in terms of enhancing transparency in GHG emissions reporting and aiding in informed environmental policy-making. By providing a clear and comprehensive visualization of emissions data, the dashboard serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, environmentalists, and the public, fostering a deeper understanding of Virginia’s GHG emissions and highlighting areas where reporting can be improved.



Future work:
For future progress, the project on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting in Virginia could focus on several key areas. Enhancing the existing dashboard tool is crucial, incorporating more recent data and improving interactivity and user-friendliness to appeal to a broader audience. Tackling the identified data gaps between reporting and non-reporting entities will be vital, possibly through innovative data collection methods or encouraging wider participation in emissions reporting. Efforts should also be directed towards promoting greater transparency and accountability in GHG reporting, which could involve policy advocacy or collaborations with governmental bodies. Expanding the study's scope both geographically and sector ally can provide a more comprehensive view of the state's emissions profile. Engaging with a diverse range of users(dashboard) - from government officials to the public - through educational initiatives and workshops is also essential to enhance awareness and participation in emissions reporting, thereby contributing significantly to environmental sustainability in Virginia.
